# 2DOF-serial-painter-robot
A 2 DOF serial link structure was designed in SolidWorks software 2- Its dynamic and kinematic equations were derived and simulated in Matlab(Simulink) 3- Different kinds of adaptive controllers were tested (LIP, Robust Control Based on Passivity, Adaptive Passivity). However, all had some problems, and as a result FAT controller was investigated. 4- Moreover, due to other issues FAT controller was not enough, so a neural network controller was also proposed. 5- after the simulation, the robot was printed and assembled. (** this project is under investigation for ICROM 2022)
