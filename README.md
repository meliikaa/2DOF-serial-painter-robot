# 2DOF-serial-painter-robot
1- A 2 DOF serial link structur was designed in solidwork software 
2- Its dynamic and kinematic equaions were derived and simulated in Matlab(simulink)
3- Differenet kinds of adaptive controller were tested (LIP,Robust Control Based on Passivity,Adaptive Passivity). However, all had some problems, as result FAT controller was investigated.
4- Moreover, due to other issues FAT controller was not enough, so a neural network controller was also proposed.
5- after simulation, the robot was printed and assembeled.
