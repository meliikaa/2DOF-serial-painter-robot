**2DOF Serial Painter Robot**

This repository contains the code and design files for a 2-degree-of-freedom (2DOF) serial link structure painter robot. The project aims to develop a robot capable of performing painting tasks efficiently and accurately.
**Features**

1-Design: The robot structure was designed using SolidWorks software, ensuring a robust and functional mechanism.

2-Simulation: The dynamic and kinematic equations of the robot were derived and simulated in Matlab (Simulink), providing a comprehensive understanding of its behavior.

3-Adaptive Controllers: Various adaptive controllers, including LIP (Linear Inverted Parameter), Robust Control Based on Passivity, and Adaptive Passivity, were tested. However, each controller exhibited certain limitations and issues.

4-FAT Controller: Considering the shortcomings of the previous controllers, the investigation focused on the FAT (Function Approximation Technique) controller, which showed promising results.

5-Neural Network Controller: In addition to the FAT controller, a neural network controller was proposed to address specific challenges and augment the robot's performance.

6-Hardware Implementation: After successful simulation, the robot was physically realized through 3D printing and assembly.
